	/// Calculate the total payment (principal and interest) required to settle a loan or an investment with a fixed interest rate over a specific time period.

	/// <param name="interestRate">The interest rate per period. For example, if you get a car loan at an annual percentage rate (APR) of 10 percent and make monthly payments, the rate per period is 0.1/12, or 0.0083.</param>
	/// <param name="numberOfPeriods">The total number of payment periods in the annuity. For example, if you make monthly payments on a four-year car loan, your loan has a total of 4 × 12 (or 48) payment periods.</param>
	/// <param name="presentValue">The present value (or lump sum) that a series of payments to be paid in the future is worth now. For example, when you borrow money to buy a car, the loan amount is the present value to the lender of the monthly car payments you will make.</param>
	/// <param name="futureValue">The future value or cash balance you want after you have made the final payment. For example, the future value of a loan is $0 because that is its value after the final payment. However, if you want to save $50,000 during 18 years for your child's education, then $50,000 is the future value. If omitted, 0 is assumed.</param>

This argument must be either DueDate.EndOfPeriod if payments are due at the end of the payment period, or DueDate.BegOfPeriod if payments are due at the beginning of the period. If omitted, DueDate.EndOfPeriod is assumed.</param>
